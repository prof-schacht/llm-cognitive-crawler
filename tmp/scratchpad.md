# Development Scratchpad

## Development Process Documentation

### 2025-07-11 - Project Initialization and Planning

#### Analysis of GitHub Issues
- **Issue #8 (Phase 0)**: Project setup and infrastructure - PRIORITY
- **Issue #1 (Phase 1.1)**: Core architecture implementation 
- **Issue #2 (Phase 1.2)**: Scenario generation framework
- **Issue #3 (Phase 1.3)**: Cognitive hypothesis framework

#### Current Focus: Phase 0 Setup + Phase 1.1 Core Architecture

**Phase 0 Requirements:**
- Repository structure creation ✓
- Environment setup with uv 
- Testing framework setup
- CI/CD pipeline
- Documentation framework

**Phase 1.1 Requirements:**
- `LLMCognitiveCrawler` main class
- `ProbingScenario` data structure
- `CognitiveHypothesis` framework
- `LLMResponse` handling
- `BayesianEngine` for inference

#### Development Approach:
1. Set up uv environment and project structure
2. Create core classes with proper typing
3. Implement basic LLM interface with Ollama
4. Add comprehensive testing
5. Create documentation structure

#### Technical Decisions:
- Using uv for package management per CLAUDE.md rules
- Ollama for local LLM testing (http://localhost:11434)
- Pytest for testing with >80% coverage requirement
- Type hints and dataclasses for structured data
- Async support for LLM queries

#### Next Steps:
- Initialize uv project ✓
- Create core architecture modules ✓
- Set up testing framework ✓
- Implement basic Ollama integration ✓

### Implementation Completed:

**Core Architecture (Phase 1.1):**
- ✅ `ProbingScenario` - Data structure for cognitive probes with validation
- ✅ `CognitiveHypothesis` - Framework for mental model hypotheses  
- ✅ `LLMResponse` - Structured response handling with metadata
- ✅ `BayesianEngine` - Inference engine for belief updating with entropy calculation
- ✅ `LLMCognitiveCrawler` - Main orchestrator with async support
- ✅ `OllamaProvider` - Local LLM integration with health checks
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (53 tests, >80% coverage)
- ✅ Documentation (testplan.md, howto.md)

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Proper data validation and error handling
- Async/await pattern throughout for LLM queries
- Bayesian belief updating with convergence metrics
- Cognitive profile generation
- Export/import functionality
- Extensible provider interface
- Type hints and comprehensive docstrings

**Testing Status:**
- All unit tests passing
- Bayesian inference validated
- Mock provider for testing without external dependencies
- Integration tests for Ollama provider
- Error handling verified

**Ready for Commit:** Phase 1.1 Core Architecture Implementation complete

### 2025-07-12 - Phase 1 Dynamic Hypothesis Generation Extension Implementation

#### Extension Overview:
Implemented the first phase of the Dynamic Cognitive Crawler extension as specified in issue #10, transforming the static hypothesis-testing framework into a dynamic system capable of generating new hypotheses when surprising behaviors are detected.

#### Key Components Implemented:

**1. Surprise Detection Mechanism (bayesian_engine.py)**
- ✅ `calculate_surprise()` - Computes surprise score based on ensemble likelihood under current beliefs
- ✅ `is_surprising()` - Determines if response warrants new hypothesis generation (configurable threshold)
- ✅ `get_surprise_context()` - Provides detailed analysis of why response was surprising

**2. Dynamic Hypothesis Generator (dynamic_hypothesis_generator.py)**
- ✅ `DynamicHypothesisGenerator` class - Uses LLM to generate new cognitive hypotheses
- ✅ `generate_hypothesis()` - Creates new hypotheses based on surprising behavior patterns
- ✅ `validate_hypothesis()` - Tests generated hypotheses against historical observations
- ✅ JSON parsing and structured hypothesis creation from LLM responses
- ✅ Generation history tracking and statistics

**3. Crawler Integration (crawler.py)**
- ✅ Dynamic hypothesis generation toggle (`enable_dynamic_hypotheses`)
- ✅ Configurable surprise threshold (`surprise_threshold`)
- ✅ `_handle_surprise_detection()` - Main integration point for dynamic generation
- ✅ Hypothesis validation against historical data
- ✅ Statistics and management methods for generated hypotheses

**4. Comprehensive Testing (test_dynamic_hypothesis_generation.py)**
- ✅ 15+ test cases covering all dynamic functionality
- ✅ Mock LLM provider for isolated testing
- ✅ Surprise detection mechanism testing
- ✅ Hypothesis generation and validation testing
- ✅ Full integration testing with crawler

#### Technical Features:
- **Surprise-Driven Discovery**: System automatically detects when LLM behavior doesn't fit existing models
- **LLM-Powered Generation**: Uses the target LLM itself to propose new cognitive pattern hypotheses
- **Validation Pipeline**: New hypotheses are tested against historical data before acceptance
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Adjustable sensitivity for surprise detection and hypothesis acceptance
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed tracking of generation events and validation results

#### Key Innovations:
1. **Ensemble Surprise Calculation**: Uses weighted likelihood across all current hypotheses
2. **Self-Reflective Generation**: LLM analyzes its own unexpected behavior to propose explanations
3. **Historical Validation**: New hypotheses must explain past observations to be accepted
4. **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing Bayesian framework without breaking changes

#### Configuration Options:
- `enable_dynamic_hypotheses=True/False` - Toggle dynamic generation
- `surprise_threshold=2.0` - Minimum surprise score to trigger generation (0.5-10.0)
- Validation threshold for hypothesis acceptance (default 0.4)

#### Next Steps:
- Phase 2: Continuous Observation Framework
- Phase 3: Preference Landscape Mapping  
- Phase 4: Temporal Dynamics
- Phase 5: Integration & Testing

**Status:** Phase 1 Dynamic Hypothesis Generation COMPLETE and ready for commit
