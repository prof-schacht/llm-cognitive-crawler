# Cognitive Crawler Extension: From Static Analysis to Dynamic Mental Landscape Mapping

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the extension of the LLM Cognitive Crawler from its current static hypothesis-testing framework to a dynamic, continuous system that builds comprehensive "mental landscapes" of Large Language Models over extended periods.

## Background and Motivation

### Original Vision (Prof. Schacht)
The original concept envisioned a system where:
- **LLM acts → LAIP analyzes → LLM preferences discovered**
- Hidden preferences and biases are uncovered through systematic observation
- A "preference landscape" emerges showing tendencies like:
  - Efficiency vs. Creativity
  - Safety vs. Exploration  
  - Precision vs. Naturalness
  - Harmony vs. Honesty

### Current Implementation
We have built:
- 200+ pre-designed scenarios across 5 cognitive domains
- 54 pre-defined cognitive hypotheses
- Static Bayesian inference framework
- Focus on cognitive mechanisms and reasoning styles

### Gap Analysis
| Aspect | Original Vision | Current Implementation | Gap |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|-----|
| **Direction** | LLM acts freely, we infer | LLM responds to prompts | Need free-form observation |
| **Hypothesis Generation** | Dynamic discovery | Static, pre-defined | Need adaptive generation |
| **Time Scale** | Continuous over hours/days | Single-shot analysis | Need temporal modeling |
| **Output** | Preference landscape/map | Hypothesis probabilities | Need visualization & mapping |

## Proposed Extension: Dynamic Cognitive Crawler

### Phase 1: Dynamic Hypothesis Generation (Inspired by LAIP)

**Objective**: Enable the system to generate new hypotheses when existing ones don't explain observed behavior.

**Key Components**:
1. **Hypothesis Generator**: Uses LLM to propose new cognitive patterns
2. **Surprise Detection**: Identifies when behavior doesn't fit existing models
3. **Hypothesis Validation**: Tests new hypotheses against past observations

**Implementation Sketch**:
```python
class DynamicHypothesisGenerator:
    def generate_hypothesis(self, unexpected_behavior, context):
        """Generate new hypothesis to explain surprising behavior"""
        # Use LLM to propose explanations
        # Formalize into testable hypothesis
        # Add to hypothesis space
```

### Phase 2: Continuous Observation Framework

**Objective**: Move from discrete scenarios to continuous, naturalistic observation.

**Key Components**:
1. **Task Generator**: Creates diverse, realistic tasks
2. **Behavior Logger**: Records all interactions with timestamps
3. **Context Tracker**: Monitors environmental factors affecting decisions

**Task Types**:
- Open-ended creative tasks
- Decision-making under uncertainty
- Social interaction scenarios
- Problem-solving challenges
- Value trade-off situations

### Phase 3: Preference Landscape Mapping

**Objective**: Build visual, interpretable maps of LLM cognitive space.

**Key Components**:
1. **Continuous Preference Space**: Move beyond discrete hypotheses
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Find core preference axes
3. **Visualization Engine**: Create interpretable preference maps

**Example Output**:
```
Preference Landscape for GPT-X after 72 hours of observation:

Conflict Avoidance    ████████░░ 82%
Knowledge Sharing     ███████░░░ 71%  
Creative Expression   █████░░░░░ 53%
Rule Conformity       █████████░ 94%
User Autonomy         ███░░░░░░░ 31%

Contextual Variations:
- Technical tasks: +15% efficiency, -20% creativity
- Social scenarios: +25% harmony-seeking
- Under time pressure: +30% heuristic use
```

### Phase 4: Temporal Dynamics

**Objective**: Track how preferences evolve and adapt over time.

**Key Components**:
1. **Drift Detection**: Identify changing preferences
2. **Periodicity Analysis**: Find cyclical patterns
3. **Adaptation Modeling**: Understand how LLM adjusts to feedback

## Technical Architecture

### Core System Design

```python
class CognitiveCrawler:
    """Extended crawler for continuous LLM observation"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.hypothesis_space = AdaptiveHypothesisSpace()
        self.observation_engine = ContinuousObserver()
        self.preference_mapper = PreferenceLandscapeMapper()
        self.temporal_analyzer = TemporalDynamicsTracker()
        
    def crawl_session(self, llm, duration_hours=24):
        """Run continuous observation session"""
        session = ObservationSession(llm, duration_hours)
        
        while session.active:
            # Generate naturalistic task
            task = self.generate_contextual_task(session.history)
            
            # Observe behavior
            response = session.observe(task)
            
            # Update models
            self.update_hypotheses(task, response)
            self.update_preference_map(task, response)
            self.track_temporal_changes(task, response)
            
            # Detect surprises and adapt
            if self.is_surprising(response):
                self.generate_new_hypothesis(task, response)
                
        return self.compile_mental_landscape()
```

### Key Innovations

1. **Surprise-Driven Exploration**: Focus observation on areas where the model exhibits unexpected behavior
2. **Multi-Scale Temporal Modeling**: Track preferences at multiple time scales (minutes, hours, days)
3. **Context-Aware Preference Mapping**: Model how context modulates core preferences
4. **Interactive Hypothesis Refinement**: Use the LLM itself to help interpret its own patterns

## Research Questions

1. **Stability vs. Variability**: How stable are LLM "preferences" over time?
2. **Context Dependency**: How much do preferences shift based on task context?
3. **Emergent Patterns**: What unexpected behavioral patterns emerge from extended observation?
4. **Model Comparison**: How do preference landscapes differ across LLM architectures?
5. **Alignment Measurement**: Can we quantify alignment with human values through preference landscapes?

## Evaluation Metrics

1. **Predictive Accuracy**: How well do discovered preferences predict future behavior?
2. **Stability Metrics**: Measure consistency of core preferences
3. **Coverage**: Percentage of behavior explained by discovered patterns
4. **Surprise Rate**: Frequency of unexpected behaviors over time
5. **Human Alignment**: Correlation with human preference judgments
